# Artixcraft
An experimental ISO which is [Archcraft](https://github.com/archcraft-os), but based on [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org)

Currently, the ISO is bootable and works, but lots of stuff are broken. Here are some issues:

* You cannot install it (because Calamares is broken)
* Theme is somewhat broken (probably due to configuration stuff not being configured during building). You can change the theme using the context menu on Openbox though (though idk how to on Bspwm)
* Shutting down / Rebooting with the built-in power menu does not work (because it depends on systemd)
* It still contains Archcraft branding.

# How to build

*Work in progress*

# The Name

It's pretty obvious: *Artix* + *Archcraft* = *Artixcraft*. Basically replacing *Arch* with *Artix*
